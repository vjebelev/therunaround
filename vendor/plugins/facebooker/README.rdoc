= Facebooker

* http://facebooker.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

Facebooker is a Ruby wrapper over the Facebook[http://facebook.com] {REST API}[http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/API].  Its goals are:

* Idiomatic Ruby
* No dependencies outside of the Ruby standard library (This is true with Rails 2.1. Previous Rails versions require the JSON gem)
* Concrete classes and methods modeling the Facebook data, so it's easy for a Rubyist to understand what's available
* Well tested


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Idiomatic Ruby
* No dependencies outside of the Ruby standard library
* Concrete classes and methods modeling the Facebook data, so it's easy for a Rubyist to understand what's available
* Well tested

== SYNOPSIS:

View David Clements' {excellent tutorial}[http://apps.facebook.com/facebooker_tutorial] at {http://apps.facebook.com/facebooker_tutorial/}[http://apps.facebook.com/facebooker_tutorial] or check out {Developing Facebook Platform Applications with Rails}[http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mmfacer].

== REQUIREMENTS:

None

== INSTALL:

=== Non Rails

The best way is:

  gem install facebooker

If, for some reason, you can't/won't use RubyGems, you can do:

  (sudo) ruby setup.rb

=== Rails

Facebooker can be installed as a Rails plugin by:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/mmangino/facebooker.git

If you don't have git, the plugin can be downloaded from http://github.com/mmangino/facebooker/tarball/master

=== Using Gem in Rails

The rake task would not be added automatically, so to use it in rails you would have to add the following towards the end of your Rakefile:
  
  require 'tasks/facebooker'

Once the plugin is installed, you will need to configure your Facebook app in config/facebooker.yml. 

Your application users will need to have added the application in facebook to access all of facebooker's features. You enforce this by adding

  ensure_application_is_installed_by_facebook_user  

to your application controller.

To prevent a violation of Facebook Terms of Service while reducing log bloat, you should also add 

  filter_parameter_logging :fb_sig_friends

to your application controller.

== using MemCache session

Facebook uses some non alphanum characters in the session identifier which interfere with memcache stored sessions. If you want to use MemCache for storing sessions, you can override the valid session id method on memcache by placing the following code in an initializer:

# add - as an okay key
class CGI
  class Session
    class MemCacheStore
      def check_id(id) #:nodoc:#
        /[^0-9a-zA-Z\-\._]+/ =~ id.to_s ? false : true
      end
    end
  end
end

== Other versions
 
 A facebooker port for Sinatra is available at http://github.com/jsmestad/frankie/tree/master
